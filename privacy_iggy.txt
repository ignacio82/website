This Privacy Policy describes how Iggy ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **API Keys**: You provide your own Google Gemini API key, which is stored locally on your device only
- **Messages and Conversations**: All chat messages, conversation history, and uploaded files are stored locally on your device
- **Voice Recordings**: When you use voice conversation mode, audio is temporarily captured and processed but is not stored permanently

### Automatically Collected Information
- **Device Information**: We may collect basic device information such as device type, operating system version, and app version for troubleshooting purposes
- **Usage Data**: Basic usage analytics may be collected to improve app performance (crash reports, feature usage)

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do NOT collect, store, or have access to your personal conversations
- We do NOT collect, store, or have access to your API keys
- We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your voice recordings to our servers
- We do NOT track your location
- We do NOT collect your name, email, phone number, or other personal identifiers unless you explicitly provide them in conversations (which remain local)

## How We Use Your Information

### Local Processing
All conversation data, API keys, and user preferences are stored and processed locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.

### Third-Party Services
The App uses the following third-party service:
- **Google Gemini API**: When you use the App, your messages and any uploaded content are sent directly from your device to Google's Gemini API using your personal API key. This communication is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google Cloud Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms). We do not intercept, store, or have access to this data.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
All user data is stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms provided by the Android operating system. You maintain full control over this data.

### Security Measures
- Your API key is stored securely in your device's encrypted storage
- All communications with Google's Gemini API use HTTPS encryption
- We implement industry-standard security practices in our code

### Data Retention
Data remains on your device until you:
- Manually delete conversations or data within the App
- Clear the App's data through your device settings
- Uninstall the App

## Your Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your data:

### Access and Control
- View, edit, or delete your conversations at any time within the App
- Remove your API key at any time

- Uninstall the App to remove all local data

### Permissions
The App requests the following permissions:
- **Microphone**: Required for voice conversation mode (optional feature)
- **Internet**: Required to communicate with Google Gemini API
- **Storage**: Required to save conversations locally

You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings, though this may limit app functionality.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete such information.

## International Data Transfers

Since all data processing occurs locally on your device and directly between your device and Google's Gemini API, we do not transfer your data internationally. However, Google may process your data in accordance with their own privacy policies and may transfer data internationally.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Providing an in-app notification for material changes

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

## Data Breaches

In the unlikely event of a data breach affecting user data, we will:
- Notify affected users within 72 hours of discovering the breach
- Provide details about what information was affected
- Offer guidance on protective measures users can take

However, since we do not store user data on our servers, the risk of data breach through our systems is minimal.
