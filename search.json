I’m passionate about using data to drive informed business decisions and contribute to YouTube’s success. I earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Virginia, and prior to joining Google in 2019, I was a researcher at Mathematica.org where I helped policymakers use data to inform decisions related to education and health policy. My journey at Google began on the Chief Economist’s team. Now at YouTube, I lead a team tasked with driving critical business decisions by measuring the impact of the YouTube Biz Org’s programs and activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
